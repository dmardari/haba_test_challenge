This is a base implementation of e2e test engine. Libs used: Spring Boot, Atlas, Selenium, Cucumber, Hamcrest, Awaitility.

You need Java SE 1.8 (this exact version) to be installed on your machine (technical limitation of current Atlas version).

To run tests on macOS in Chrome just call
$ ./gradlew test

If you prefer other browser, just call
$ ./gradlew test -Dbrowser=safari
